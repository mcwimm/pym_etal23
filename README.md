## pyMANGA input

The 'input' folder contains examples of pyMANGA project files used in the simulation experiment.
The examples represent the 4 combinations of mortality and resource modules.

|Setup|Below-ground processes|Mortality processes|
|--|--|--|
|1|1 (resource limitation)|1 (mechanistic)|
|2|1 (resource limitation)|2 (+ growth-dependent)|
|3|2 (+ competition)|1 (mechanistic)|
|4|2 (+ competition)|2 (+ growth-dependent)|

pyMANGA project files are provided for pyMANGA version v.3.0.0 which was used for the study.
The project file structure has been changed with version v.3.1.0, so the folder contains examples to run with this version as well.
